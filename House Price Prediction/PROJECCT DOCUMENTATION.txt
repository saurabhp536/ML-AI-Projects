# **Documentation: House Price Prediction Using Advanced Linear Regression Techniques**

## **Project Overview**
The House Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices based on various features provided in the dataset. It leverages advanced linear regression techniques, including Ridge and Lasso regression, to enhance prediction accuracy. The project is implemented in Python using Google Colab.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains various features about houses, such as the number of bedrooms, location, and size. The target variable is the house price.

### **Key Features:**
- **Numerical Features:** Area, Number of Rooms, Age of the Property, etc.
- **Categorical Features:** Location, Type of House, etc.

---

## **Tools and Libraries**
The following tools and libraries are used in this project:
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- **Platform:** Google Colab.

## **Methodology**

### **Step 1: Import Libraries**
The project begins with importing the required libraries for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

### **Step 2: Load the Dataset**
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and the first few rows are displayed for initial inspection.

### **Step 3: Data Exploration and Cleaning**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Check for missing values.
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Visualize feature distributions and relationships using heatmaps and pair plots.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical features using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
   - Standardize numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

### **Step 4: Feature Selection**
Select relevant features for the prediction model by analyzing correlations and domain knowledge.

### **Step 5: Data Splitting**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split) to evaluate model performance.

### **Step 6: Model Implementation**
1. **Linear Regression:** Basic model to predict house prices.
2. **Ridge Regression:** Regularization technique to address overfitting.
3. **Lasso Regression:** Feature selection and regularization.

### **Step 7: Model Evaluation**
Evaluate models using metrics such as:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R2 Score

### **Step 8: Model Comparison**
Compare the performance of different models using bar charts for RMSE and R2 Scores.

---

## **Results**
The results include:
- Performance metrics for each regression model.
- Visual comparisons of models based on RMSE and R2 Score.

---

## **Conclusion**
The best-performing model is identified based on its ability to minimize RMSE and maximize R2 Score. Regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) often improve performance compared to basic linear regression.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Include additional features to improve model accuracy.
- Experiment with other machine learning models, such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
- Deploy the model using a web-based interface for real-world applications.
